## 1. Introduction to On-chip clock multiplier

 This repository focuses on design of On-Chip clock multiplier / PLL for VSD Open 2021 PLL Workshop.
 In this repository we are going to cover a brief description on PLL and also its pre-layout and post-layout simulations. 
 PLL is found in many wireless, radio, and general electronic items from mobile phones to broadcast radios, televisions to Wi-Fi routers, walkie talkie radios to professional   communications systems etc.
The On-chip clock multiplier is present in almost all synchronous processor chips (Integrated circuits).

## 2. EDA Tools Used 
The design has been built using open-source EDA tools. The library used is osu180nm. 

üåü Ngspice
 
   * Ngspice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal electronic circuit simulator.
   * Ngspice is based on three open-source free-software packages: 
      * Spice3f5
      * Xspice
      * Cider1b1
   
      üîó http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/
      
 üåü Magic
 
  * Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license, magic has remained popular with universities and small companies.
  * The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of fabrication technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms which lend to magic the greatest part of its popularity.
  * Magic is widely cited as being the easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people who ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product design flow.
